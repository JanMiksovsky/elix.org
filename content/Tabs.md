# Tabs

`Tabs` is a set of tabbed panels that can be navigated by selecting corresponding tab buttons. `Tabs` takes care of the relative positioning of the tab buttons and the tab panels, and ensures that the selection state of the buttons and panels remains in sync. A typical example of `Tabs` being used for navigation, using custom tab buttons:

[Tabs used for navigation](/demos/toolbarTabs.html)

You can select a tab with mouse/touch or a keyboard.

The `Tabs` class is registered as element `<elix-tabs>`.

## Usage

Use `Tabs` for situations in which the user can directly control which modal state is presented. Tabs are typically used to allow a UI to offer more controls than can fit in a confined area at a time.

* A common use case is Settings or configuration UIs. Here the classic look of a
  tabbed dialog or property sheet is addressed with the Elix's default
  [TabButton](TabButton) elements, although other looks are possible.
* Tabs may also be used in a main window to downplay less-commonly used aspects
  of a UI.
* Tabs are also an extremely common navigation model. Many mobile applications
  present a navigation toolbar that behave like tabs, presenting 3â€“5 buttons
  that correspond to the app's main areas. In navigation use cases, the tab
  buttons typically have a toolbar button style rather than a classic tabbed
  appearance.


## Using default tab buttons

By default, you only need to provide `Tabs` with child items that it will use as the tab panels. For best results, give each panel a text lable in an `aria-label` attribute.

    <elix-tabs>
      <div aria-label="One">Page one</div>
      <div aria-label="Two">Page two</div>
      <div aria-label="Three">Page three</div>
    </elix-tabs>

For each panel, `Tabs` will create a [TabButton](TabButton) instance, and that panel's `aria-label` as the content of the tab button.

## Positioning and aligning tab buttons

`Tabs` exposes [tabPosition](#tabPosition) and [tabAlign](#tabAlign) properties that let you control, respectively, how the strip of tabs is positioned with respect to the panels and how they are visually aligned within the strip of tabs.

[You can customize tab position and alignment](/demos/tabPositions.html)


## Custom content in default tab buttons

If you would like to use the default tab button appearance, but have more control over the content of the tab buttons, you can create the tab buttons yourself. Add a `slot="tabButtons"` attribute to each button to specify that you want it to be treated as a tab button:

    <elix-tabs>
      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Un</elix-tab-button>
      <div aria-label="One">Page one</div>

      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Deux</elix-tab-button>
      <div aria-label="Two">Page two</div>

      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Trois</elix-tab-button>
      <div aria-label="Three">Page three</div>
    </elix-tabs>

Because the `<elix-tab-button>` instances are HTML elements, you can include arbitrarily complex content inside them: add icons, other graphical elements, etc.

As long as the relative order of the tab buttons and the panel elements are consistent, it doesn't matter where the tab buttons appear. You can interleave them with the panels (above) or, if it's more convenient, group the tab buttons together:

    <elix-tabs>
      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Un</elix-tab-button>
      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Trois</elix-tab-button>
      <elix-tab-button slot="tabButtons">Deux</elix-tab-button>

      <div aria-label="One">Page one</div>
      <div aria-label="Two">Page two</div>
      <div aria-label="Three">Page three</div>
    </elix-tabs>

In either case, the result is:

## Using custom tab buttons

You can also provide your custom elements as the tab buttons. For example, the demo showing tabs used for navigation at the top of this page can be created using code along these lines: 

    <elix-tabs tab-position="bottom" tab-align="stretch">

      <toolbar-tab slot="tabButtons" aria-label="Home">
        <div class="material-icons">home</div>
        Home
      </toolbar-tab>

      <toolbar-tab slot="tabButtons" aria-label="Search">
        <div class="material-icons">search</div>
        Search
      </toolbar-tab>

      <toolbar-tab slot="tabButtons" aria-label="Settings">
        <div class="material-icons">settings</div>
        Settings
      </toolbar-tab>

      <div>Home page</div>
      <div>Search page</div>
      <div>Settings page</div>

    </elix-tabs>

This uses Google's [Material Design icons](https://material.io/icons/) for button icons, but you can use whatever techniques are appropriate for your app's visual design.


## Creating your own tabbed components

`Tabs` is constructed from lower-lever parts which you can recombine to create more specialized tab UIs.

At its core, the `Tabs` component manages a set of tab buttons, and assumes a standard tabbed UI design in which clicking a tab immediately makes the corresponding tab panel visible. Internally, `Tabs` relies on instances of other Elix elements:

* [Modes](Modes) ensures that only a single panel is shown at a time.
* [TabStrip](TabStrip) presents and aligns a set of tabs, and allows a single tab to be selected at a time.
* [TabButton](TabButton) provides the default tab button appearance.

You can use these parts to create novel tabbed UI elements of your own. You might, for example, use `TabStrip` and `TabButton` to present the tabs, but combine these with a different container for panels to provide a more sophisticated visual transition.
