# ShadowTemplateMixin

**Purpose:** Create a component's shadow root, and clone a template into it when it is first rendered.

This mixin forms a core part of the [Elix render pipeline](/documentation#elix-render-pipeline):

> events → methods → setState → **render** ➞ **update DOM**

**Expects** the component to provide:
* Internal `symbols.template` property that returns a string to `<template>` element.

**Provides** the component with:
* Internal `symbols.render()` method that creates and populates the shadow root the first time the component is rendered.
* `$` property that can be used to access elements in the shadow tree that have `id` attributes. See [the `$` property](#$).

All Elix [elements](elements) use `ShadowTemplateMixin` to populate their Shadow DOM subtree with template elements.


## Usage

    import ShadowTemplateMixin from 'elix/src/ShadowTemplateMixin.js';
    class MyElement extends ShadowTemplateMixin(HTMLElement) {}

### Example

    class GreetElement extends ShadowTemplate(HTMLElement) {

      connectedCallback() {
        this[symbols.render]();
      }

      get [symbols.template]() {
        return `
          Hello, <slot></slot>!
        `;
      }

    }

    const element = new GreetElement();
    element.textContent = 'world';      // User sees, "Hello, world!"

When the element above is instantiated, the constructor supplied by `ShadowTemplateMixin` finds the element's template and stamps it into a new shadow root.


## Rendering

This mixin does its primary work in a component's `symbols.render` method. The first time that method is called:

* The mixin looks for a template property (see below).
* If the [ShadyCSS](https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss) polyfill is loaded, the mixin uses it to prepare the template.
* The mixin attaches a new, open shadow root.
* The mixin clones the prepared template into the shadow root.
* If the ShadyCSS polyfill is loaded, in the component's `connectedCallback`, the mixin invokes ShadyCSS to apply styles to the new component instance.


## The template property

The `ShadowTemplateMixin` expects a component to define a property getter identified as [symbols.template](symbols#template). If this property has not been defined, the mixin issues a console warning, but does not throw an exception.

The property can return a component template as either a real HTML `<template>` element or, for convenience, as a string. The mixin will upgrade a string template to a real `<template>`.

The template can come from anywhere. It can be embedded in the JavaScript as a backquoted template string (as shown in the example above), or it be loaded from some other resource.

## Template caching

For better performance, `ShadowTemplateMixin` caches a component's processed template.

The mixin reads the `[symbols.template]` property once, in the `constructor`. After processing the template (upgrading a string template to a `<template>`, and preparing the template for use with ShadyCSS), the processed template is cached.

Subsequent component instantiations will use the cached template directly.
