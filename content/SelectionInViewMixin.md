# SelectionInViewMixin

In horizontally or vertically scrollable lists, the component may be asked to
select an item which is not currently in view. The `SelectionInViewMixin`
listens for changes in the selection and, if the newly-selected item is not in
view, scrolls the component by the minimum amount necessary to bring the item
into view.

The following [ListBox](ListBox) lets users navigate the selection with the
keyboard using Up/Down keys, Page Up/Page Down, Home/End. Navigation is handled
by [KeyboardDirectionMixin](KeyboardDirectionMixin) and
[KeyboardPagedSelectionMixin](KeyboardPagedSelectionMixin). Those mixins only
change the selected item, but not directly scroll the list. Instead, as the user
changes the selection, `SelectionInViewMixin` keeps the selection visible.

For reference, the Blink engine has a `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` function that
does something similar, but unfortunately it's non-standard, and often ends up
scrolling more than is absolutely necessary.

The component's scrolling surface may be the component itself, or it may be an
element within the component's shadow subtree. By default,
`SelectionInViewMixin` will try to determine which element should be scrolled.
If the component has a default (unnamed) `<slot>`, the mixin will find the
closest ancestor of that slot that has `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll`.
If no such element is found, the component itself will be assumed to be the
scrollable element.

A component can also explicitly indicate which of its shadow subtree elements
should be scrolled by defining a property called
[symbols.scrollTarget](symbols#scrollTarget) that returns the desired element.
