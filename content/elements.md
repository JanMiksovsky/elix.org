# Elements

The Elix elements are a collection of web components implementing extremely
common general-purpose user interface patterns.

These elements are all designed to satisfy the [Gold Standard checklist for Web
Components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki), and so are
intended to be immediately useful in your web projects.

Since no solution is perfect for everyone, all of these elements are built from
smaller [mixins](mixins) that you can recombine to suit your needs. In that
case, you may find the Elix elements helpful as reference examples.
