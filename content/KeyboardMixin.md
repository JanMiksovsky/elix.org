# KeyboardMixin

**Purpose:** lets a component and multiple mixins all handle keyboard events with a single `keydown` event listener.

This mixin works at the beginning of the [Elix render pipeline](/documentation#elix-render-pipeline):

> **events** ➞ **methods** → setState → updates → render DOM → post-render

**Provides** the component with:
* `symbols.keydown` method invoked for each `keydown` event.
* `tabindex` attribute of 0 if no `tabindex` attribute is set on an instance. This ensures the component can receive keyboard events.


## Usage

    import KeyboardMixin from 'elix/src/KeyboardMixin.js';
    class MyElement extends KeyboardMixin(HTMLElement) {}


Keyboard support is an important aspect of supporting universal access, as covered in the Gold Standard checklist item [Keyboard Support](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki/Keyboard-Support)
(Can you use the basic aspects of component exclusively with the keyboard?) Along with supporting the keyboard, your component should also support the checklist item [Declared Semantics](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki/Declared-Semantics)
(Does the component expose its semantics by wrapping/extending a native element, or using ARIA roles, states, and properties?). See [AriaListMixin](AriaListMixin) for more details.

Some related keyboard mixins that rely on `KeyboardMixin` to invoke `symbols.keydown` include [KeyboardDirectionMixin](KeyboardDirectionMixin), [KeyboardPagedSelectionMixin](KeyboardPagedSelectionMixin), and [KeyboardPrefixSelectionMixin](KeyboardPrefixSelectionMixin).

See also [FocusVisibleMixin](FocusVisibleMixin), which can be used to ensure an element only shows a focus indication if the user accesses the element with the keyboard.


### Example

    class EnterElement extends KeyboardMixin(HTMLElement) {
      [symbols.keydown](event) {
        if (event.keyCode === 13 /* Enter */) {
          console.log("Enter key was pressed.");
          return true; // We handled the event.
        }
        // We didn't handle the event; invoke super.
        return super[symbols.keydown] && super[symbols.keydown](event);
      }
    }


## Handling keys

This mixin uses a `keydown` listener rather than `keyup`, as most keyboard behavior (e.g., pressing arrow keys) should respond on keydown for faster response time and to allow key repeats. A `keydown` event is used instead of `keypress` because `keypress` is not fired when many keys are pressed, including Tab, Delete, backspace, arrow keys. (See this [webkit changelog](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2007-December/002992.html) for more details.)

When `KeyboardMixin` receives a keydown event, it invokes a method called `symbols.keydown`, passing in the event object. The component or its other mixins can then take their turns examining the event.
