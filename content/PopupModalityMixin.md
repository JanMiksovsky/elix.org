# PopupModalityMixin

**Purpose:** makes an overlay behave like a popup by dismissing it when certain user interactions occur. This mixin is generally used in conjunction with [OverlayMixin](OverlayMixin) for basic overlay behavior.

This mixin works in the middle of the [Elix render pipeline](/documentation#elix-render-pipeline):

> events → **methods** ➞ **methods** → setState → updates → render DOM → post-render

**Expects** the component to provide:
* `close` method and `closed` property, typically via [OpenCloseMixin](OpenCloseMixin).
* `keydown` method for keyboard events, typically via [KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin).

**Provides** the component with:
* Event handlers that close the element if the user clicks outside the element, presses the Esc key, moves the focus outside the element, scrolls the document, resizes the document, or switches focus away from the document.
* A default ARIA `role` of `alert`.


## Usage

    import PopupModalityMixin from 'elix/src/PopupModalityMixin.js';
    class MyElement extends PopupModalityMixin(HTMLElement) {}

Use `PopupModalityMixin` for lightweight overlays the user does not need to respond to, such as notifications, popup menus, and tooltips. The user can implicitly dismiss such popups by interacting elsewhere in the UI.

For modal overlays, use [DialogModalityMixin](DialogModalityMixin) instead. See the documentation of that mixin for a comparison of modality behaviors.


### Example

[This overlay's behavior comes from `PopupModalityMixin`](/demos/popup.html)
