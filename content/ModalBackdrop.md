# ModalBackdrop

A simple backdrop for a modal overlay such as a [Dialog](Dialog) or [Drawer](Drawer). The backdrop slightly obscures the background elements, focusing the user's attention on the overlay. It also contributes to the modality by absorbing background clicks.

[A `ModalBackdrop` appears behind a `Dialog` to partially obscure the background](/demos/dialog.html)
