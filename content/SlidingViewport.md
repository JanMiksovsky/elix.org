# SlidingViewport

Displays a set of items on a horizontal axis, with a single item completely visible at a time. It shows a sliding transition when changing which item is selected.

`SlidingViewport` provides no interaction on its own, but is the basis for carousel-like components in Elix, including [Carousel](Carousel) and [SlidingPages](SlidingPages) (shown below). Those components handle a variety of input methods to let the user navigate which item is shown in the viewport.

[You can navigate this `SlidingPages` with touch/mouse/keyboard/trackpad](/demos/slidingPages.html)
