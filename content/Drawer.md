# Drawer

A drawer is a modal panel that slides in from the side of the page. A drawer is generally used to provide navigation in situations where: a) screen real estate is constrained and b) the navigation UI is not critical to completing the user’s primary goal (and, hence, not critical to the application’s business goal).

`Drawer` displays a [ModalBackdrop](ModalBackdrop) behind the main overlay content to help the user understand the modal condition. Both the backdrop and the dialog itself can be styled.

`Drawer` is very similar to [Dialog](Dialog) in construction, and provides the same level of [keyboard support](Dialog#keyboard-support).

The user may dismiss the drawer by pressing Esc, or by swiping to the side with touch or the trackpad. You may also provide a UI element inside the drawer — e.g., a close box — that dismisses the drawer.
