# Modes

The `Modes` component shows exactly one of its assigned children at any given time. It can be thought of as a list that only shows the currently selected item.

`Modes` uses [SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin) to expose a single selection. A developer must programmatically modify which item is currently visible, as `Modes` provides no user interface itself.

The `Modes` class is registered as element `<elix-modes>`.

## Usage

`Modes` can be used for any portion of a UI with a modal state that can display two or more different sets of UI controls depending upon the state. This pattern is so common that developers rarely think of it as a thing itself. Historically, they have often created a containing `div` holding an inner `div` for each modal state, then show the `div` for the current state and hide the rest. But rewriting that code each time is slow and error-prone. `Modes` serves this need in much the same way as Polymer's `iron-pages` component.
