# Developer documentation

This section is organized into three areas:

* [Elements](/documentation/elements):Â web components which you can use directly in your web
  projects, or as starting points for your own components. These elements do
  their best to meet [Gold Standard checklist for Web
  Components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki), a rigorous
  standard for ensuring a high level of component quality.

* [Mixins](/documentation/mixins): aspects of component behavior that can be combined to
  create functional web components that meet the Gold Standard.

* [Wrappers](/documentation/wrappers): a kind of mixin that adds visible
  elements to a component's template.
