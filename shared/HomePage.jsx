                Elix is a community-driven collection of high-quality web components
                for common user interface patterns such as lists, menus, dialogs,
                carousels, and so on. The modular nature of web components let you
                easily incorporate them into your web apps, and their standard
                definition ensures good results across all mainstream browsers.

              <h1>Overview</h1>
              <p>
                Most applications make use of common, general-purpose user interface
                patterns such lists, menus, dialogs, carousels, and so on. Such
                patterns can be efficiently implemented and packaged as web
                components. Their modular nature lets you easily incorporate web
                components into your web application, and their standard definition
                ensures good results across browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                This arrangement permits a beneficial economy of scale, as common
                patterns only have to be implemented once. But that is not to say
                that itâ€™s easy to develop general-purpose user interface patterns as
                solid components. To the contrary, implementing even simple patterns
                with a very high degree of quality can entail substantial
                complexity.
              </p>
              <p>
                For that reason, the Elix project believes that implementing
                high-quality, general-purpose components is best done as a community
                effort. This spreads the cost of creating the components across
                organizations, and ensures that the resulting components satisfy a
                broad range of concerns and can be used in many contexts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Elix and its community-driven process are currently in a pilot
                phase. These components are not ready for production use. The Elix
                core team will share more about the project road map and our plans
                for open process as those plans come together.
